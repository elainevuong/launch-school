/*
The insurance guy calls again and apologizes. They found another policy made by your spouse, 
but this one is limited to cover a particular maximum in losses (for example, 50,000â‚¬). 
You send a bill to your spouse for the difference you lost.

Given an object of the stolen items and a limit, return the difference 
between the total value of those items and the limit of the policy.

The object will always contain items (no empty objects).
The sum of the items will always be greater than the limit.
