<!-- 
  Will the following code display the two article boxes side-by-side? 
  If not, why not? How would you fix it so that it places the boxes side-by-side?
  

  The browser won't display the article boxes side-by-side since they are block elements. 
  Even if we could place the block elements side-by-side, they won't fit inside the section 
  because the total width of each article is 50% of the width plus 22 pixels for its padding and border.

  The first change we must make is to add display: inline-block; to the CSS article 
  selector, which lets us position two or more articles side-by-side, provided 
  there is room. To make them fit, we must set the actual width (including padding 
  and the border) to 50% of the available space, so we also add box-sizing: border-box; 
  to the article selector.
