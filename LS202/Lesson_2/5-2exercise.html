<!-- 
  What is the minimum width and height (in pixels) that the div needs to entirely contain 
  the section element (including its margins)? How does this differ from the result of the 
  previous practice problem?

  Inline Block - exclude Margins

  Since the div uses border-box box-sizing, it must have a width and height of at least 580px and 360px, 
  respectively. These values are identical to the answer from the previous practice problem. 
  
  The chief difference is that other elements may appear adjacent to the 
  img in problem 1, while the section in this problem will always be on a line by itself 
  within the div no matter its width.

  With problem 1, because we use inline block - other elements may appear adjacent to the image in problem 1, while the
  section in this problem will always be on a line by itself, within the div no matter its width.
