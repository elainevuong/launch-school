<!-- 
  When you put the article elements on separate lines in the HTML, the browser sees the whitespace 
  (a newline and several spaces in this case) between the two articles. It then collapses that 
  whitespace into a single space character and uses the result as content between the elements. 

  Thus, the two articles require 900 pixels total plus a few more pixels to account for the space 
  character. Since that exceeds the 900-pixel width of the section, the two articles no longer fit on the same line.

  Due to the whitespace characters! Be careful when using inline-blocks and whitespace characters. 

  This kind of problem often occurs when one of the elements is an inline-block; the rest of the time, 
  the extra space typically doesn't matter. Aside from placing the two tags up against each other to 
  eliminate the whitespace, there are several other techniques you will see later that let you 
  remove the space or make it invisible.
