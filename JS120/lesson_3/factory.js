/* 
1. What are two disadvantages of working with factory functions?
**Method Redundancies & Memory Intensive -** 
Each object created by the factory function has a copy of all 
the methods, which can be redundant and memory intensive.

**Loss of Creation History -** 
There is no way to tell which factory function created which object, 
so there is no way to be sure that you're working with the 
right kind of object.
*/

// In this problem and the remaining problems, we'll build a simple invoice processing program. 
// To get you started, here's the code to process a single invoice:

/* 
let invoice = {
  phone: 3000,
  internet: 6500
};

let payment = {
  phone: 1300,
  internet: 5500
};

let invoiceTotal = invoice.phone + invoice.internet;
let paymentTotal = payment.phone + payment.internet;
let remainingDue = invoiceTotal - paymentTotal;

console.log(paymentTotal);         // => 6800
console.log(remainingDue);         // => 2700
*/

/*
To process multiple invoices, we need a factory method that we can use to create invoices. 
The requirements for the factory function are as follows:

It returns an invoice object, with phone and internet properties, and a total method.
The default value for the phone service is 3000, and the internet service is 5500 
(in cents, of course!).
The function takes an object argument whose attributes override the default values.
*/

function createInvoice(services = {}) {
  let phoneCharge = services.phone;
  if (phoneCharge === undefined) {
    phoneCharge = 3000;
  }

  let internetCharge = services.internet;
  if (internetCharge === undefined) {
    internetCharge = 5500;
  }

  return {
    phone: phoneCharge,
    internet: internetCharge,

    total: function() {
      return this.phone + this.internet;
    }
  };
}

function invoiceTotal(invoices) {
  let total = 0;

  for (let index = 0; index < invoices.length; index += 1) {
    total += invoices[index].total();
  }

  return total;
}

let invoices = [];
invoices.push(createInvoice());
invoices.push(createInvoice({ internet: 6500 }));
invoices.push(createInvoice({ phone: 2000 }));
invoices.push(createInvoice({
  phone: 1000,
  internet: 4500,
}));

console.log(invoiceTotal(invoices)); // 31000
/* 
Now we can build a factory function to create payments. 
The function can take an object argument in one of 3 forms:

Payment for one service, e.g., { internet: 1000 } or { phone: 1000 }.
Payment for both services, e.g., { internet: 2000, phone: 1000 }.
Payment with just an amount property, e.g., { amount: 2000 }.
The function should return an object that has the amount paid for each service and a total method that returns the payment total. If the amount property is not present in the argument, it should return the sum of the phone and internet service charges; if the amount property is present, return the value of that property.

Your function should work with the following code:
*/

function createPayment(services = {}) {
  let payment = {
    phone: services.phone || 0,
    internet: services.internet || 0,
    amount: services.amount,
  };

  payment.total = function() {
    return this.amount || (this.phone + this.internet);
  };

  return payment;
}

/* 
Update the createInvoice function so that it can add payment(s) 
to invoices. Use the following code as a guideline
*/

function createInvoice(services = {}) {
  let phoneCharge = services.phone;
  if (phoneCharge === undefined) {
    phoneCharge = 3000;
  }

  let internetCharge = services.internet;
  if (internetCharge === undefined) {
    internetCharge = 5500;
  }

  return {
    phone: phoneCharge,
    internet: internetCharge,
    payments: [],

    total: function() {
      return this.phone + this.internet;
    },

    addPayment: function(payment) {
      this.payments.push(payment);
    },

    addPayments: function(payments) {
      payments.forEach(this.addPayment, this);
    },

    paymentTotal: function() {
      return this.payments.reduce((sum, payment) => sum + payment.total(), 0);
    },

    amountDue: function() {
      return this.total() - this.paymentTotal();
    },
  };
}
