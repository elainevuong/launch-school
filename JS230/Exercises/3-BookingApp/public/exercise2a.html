<!--
Implement a function that retrieves all the 
schedules that are available. If one or more 
schedules are available, tally the count of 
schedules for each staff and alert the user of 
result as "key: value" pairs with the staff id as 
key (in the format of 'staff {id}'; e.g, 'staff 1') and 
the count of schedules as the value. If there are no schedules, 
alert the user that there are currently no schedules available for booking.

When implementing the function, keep in mind that server 
has been known to slow down when there are more than 7 schedules 
to retrieve. It doesn't always happen, but be sure to handle it accordingly. 

Once 5 seconds have passed, cancel the retrieval and inform the user to try again.

Finally, inform the user about the completion of the request 
regardless of the success or failure (timeout) of the request.

Note: Server slow down for when there are more than 7 schedules 
to retrieve is manufactured only. For reference, the manufactured time is 7 seconds.

When running the JavaScript code, be sure that you're not 
doing cross origin requests; the app is not set to handle it. 
The easiest way to avoid it is to create an HTML file in the 
public directory of the app, access that file (page) via the 
proper path, and run the JS code from the web page.

For example, if you've created a public/exercise1.html file 
you'll access it via: http://localhost:3000/exercise1.html.
